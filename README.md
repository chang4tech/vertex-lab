## Changelog

For a detailed list of changes and fixes, see `CHANGELOG.md` at the project root.

## Plugins

Vertex Lab supports plugins that contribute UI panels, canvas overlays, and commands. Manage plugins via Settings → Plugins (enable/disable core plugins and import custom `.js/.mjs` plugins). The host error‑isolates plugin panels, dedupes plugins by id (first occurrence wins), and surfaces plugin commands in the context menu when applicable.

- Control Hub: Each plugin has a localized Control Hub with sections for “How to Use”, “Settings”, and a “Console” with Copy/Clear.
- How to Use: Authors can provide a simple `aboutPage.markdown` string for richer docs; it’s rendered as lightweight Markdown.
- First‑time tip: When you enable a plugin for the first time, a localized banner appears linking to its Control Hub.
- Incomplete indicator: Plugins with no visible contributions (no panels, commands, overlays, about, or config) show an “Incomplete” badge in the Plugins dialog.

See `doc/PLUGIN_SPEC.md` for the full specification. Migration and progress notes are summarized in `doc/progress.md` and tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.0 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vertex-lab-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

### Backend Services

A Fastify-powered API is available under `server/`. Install its dependencies separately and run it alongside the front-end.

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env # update as needed
npm run dev
```

The backend listens on port 4000 by default; adjust the `.env` file if the port conflicts with other services.

For persistent teams, set `DATABASE_URL` to a Postgres instance (see `doc/BACKEND_SETUP.md` for setup). Local development defaults to SQLite at `server/data/vertex.db`.

If the API is unavailable, Vertex Lab automatically falls back to local storage so you can keep saving and loading diagrams offline. Changes sync once the backend is reachable again.

Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your front-end `.env` (see `.env.example`) if the API runs somewhere else. You can also override at runtime by defining `window.__VERTEX_CONFIG__ = { apiBaseUrl: 'https://api.example.com' }` before the app script loads.

For production deployments, edit `public/runtime-config.js` (copied verbatim to `dist/runtime-config.js`) to point at the desired API host without triggering a rebuild.


### Access from other devices (same network)

- Start on LAN: `npm run dev -- --host`
- Use the Network URL Vite prints (e.g., `http://192.168.1.23:5173`)
- On your phone (same Wi‑Fi), open that URL in a browser
- Alternative (prod-like): `npm run build` then `npm run preview -- --host`
- Optional config: set `server: { host: true, port: 5173 }` in `vite.config.js`
- Troubleshooting: ensure same Wi‑Fi (not guest), allow Node/Vite through firewall, disable VPNs, and use the IP URL (not `localhost`)

For more details, see `doc/DEV_SERVER.md`.

## Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **Creating Nodes**
   - Click a node and press `Tab` to add a connected node (neighbor) and link it
   - Press `Enter` to rename the selected node

2. **Editing Nodes**
  - Click a node to select it
  - Press `Enter` to rename the selected node
  - Drag nodes to reposition them
  - Use Ctrl/Cmd-click to multi-select; Shift + drag to marquee select
  - With multiple nodes selected, press `E` to connect/disconnect them (first selected is the anchor)

3. **Navigation**
  - Hold Space + Left Click to pan the canvas
   - Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
   - Click the Center button to focus on root node
   - Use View menu for zoom controls

4. **File Operations**
   - Use File menu or keyboard shortcuts for import/export
   - Save frequently used layouts as templates
   - Export your diagram as PNG for sharing

### Template Library

1. **Saving Templates**
   - Create your diagram layout
   - Click Library > Save to Library
   - Enter a name for your template

2. **Loading Templates**
   - Click Library > Load from Library
   - Select a template from the list
   - The template will replace current diagram

- **MenuBar**: Application menu and toolbar functionality
- **HelpPanel**: Keyboard shortcuts and help documentation

## Testing

- Unit/UI (Vitest):
  - `npm test` – run all tests once
  - `npm run test:watch` – watch mode
  - `npm run test:coverage` – coverage report
  - `npm run test:ui` – Vitest UI

- Mobile E2E (Playwright):
  - Uses Playwright-downloaded browsers for fidelity (Chromium + WebKit).
  - One-time installs:
    - All: `npm run playwright:install:all`
    - Chromium only: `npm run playwright:install:chromium`
    - WebKit only (Mobile Safari engine): `npm run playwright:install:webkit`
  - `npm run test:e2e` – runs across configured mobile profiles (Chromium Pixel 5 + WebKit iPhone 12 + Mobile Firefox).
  - `npm run test:e2e:ui` – opens Playwright UI.
  - `npm run test:e2e:mobile` – runs Mobile Safari (WebKit) only.
  - `npm run test:e2e:ff` – runs Mobile Firefox profile.
  - Notes: tests live under `src/__tests__/e2e/`; Vite preview server auto-starts via `playwright.config.js` and prebuilds (`pretest:e2e`).

Configurable preview host/port:
- Change the preview server port/host that Playwright uses without editing files:
  - `PREVIEW_PORT=5174 npm run test:e2e`
  - `PREVIEW_HOST=0.0.0.0 PREVIEW_PORT=8080 npm run test:e2e`
- Reuse an already running preview server instead of starting one:
  - Terminal 1: `npm run build && npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5174`
  - Terminal 2: `SKIP_WEB_SERVER=1 PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5174 npm run test:e2e`

### Playwright install troubleshooting
- macOS 12 WebKit warning: Playwright ships a frozen WebKit for macOS 12; tests still run, but update macOS for latest engine.
- Proxy/localhost issues (ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:443): clear proxy env vars when installing:
  - `env -u HTTPS_PROXY -u HTTP_PROXY -u ALL_PROXY npx playwright install`
- Alternate mirror (if your region blocks defaults):
  - `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=https://playwright.azureedge.net npx playwright install`
- CI caching: keep default `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0` to install under project.
